Tratto is a tiny framework I  built to issue commands to cisco 
routers over ssh and telnet.  I used pexpect.

Systems.py - Is a file that defines properties of different
operating systems

Connectivity.py - Is a file that defines connectivity objects
such as Session.

test.py -  Example usages of how to use Tratto.

Examples - A Directory of real-world examples of tratto
   l3toPTR.py - A script that connects to a Cisco IOS device
                issues "sho ip int br" and generates dns names
                for the given l3 interface.  This can be useful
                to generate ptr records for traceroutes. 


tratto is now a somewhat proper module, so you can import it like:
from tratto.systems import * etc...

Systems.OperatingSystems has been replaced with tratto.systems.SystemProfiles
